we are using Bluetooth for transmission and receiving data.

Bluetooth security is to safeguard administrations presented by gadgets as well as allow without a doubt, unmistakable gadgets to associate. just like Wi-Fi Bluetooth can be very risky at some times. 

Some people do not turn off Bluetooth after using it they think that is not important thatâ€™s where they are wrong. 

There are many attacks like Eavesdropping, Denial of Service, Impersonation attack, etc. So here, we are introducing a cryptographic algorithm to secure Bluetooth transmission, and even if an attacker attacks on open Bluetooth our data will be secured. 

We have seen many symmetric asymmetric key algorithms. Many of them can be decoded by brute force but this algorithm can be decoded by brute force that much easier if they're more than enough data.
